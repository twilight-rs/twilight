//! Flow for managing ratelimit tickets.
//!
//! Tickets are the [`Ratelimiter`]'s method of managing approval for a consumer
//! to be able to send a request.
//!
//! # Ratelimit Consumer
//!
//! ## 1. Requesting a ticket
//!
//! Consumers of a ratelimiter will call [`Ratelimiter::ticket`].
//!
//! ## 2. Waiting for approval
//!
//! In return consumers will receive a [`TicketReceiver`]. This must be polled
//! in order to know when the ratelimiter has approved a ticket.
//!
//! ## 3. Receiving approval
//!
//! When a ticket is approved and the future resolves, a [`TicketSender`] is
//! provided. This must be used to provide the ratelimiter with the response's
//! ratelimit headers.
//!
//! ## 4. Performing the request
//!
//! Consumers may now execute the HTTP request associated with the ticket. Once
//! a response (or lack of one) is received, the headers [must be parsed] and
//! sent to the ratelimiter via [`TicketSender::headers`]. This completes the
//! cycle.
//!
//! # Ratelimiter
//!
//! ## 1. Initializing a ticket's channels
//!
//! Ratelimiters will accept a request for a ticket when [`Ratelimiter::ticket`]
//! is called. You must call [`channel`] to create a channel between the
//! ratelimiter and the consumer.
//!
//! ## 2. Keeping the consumer waiting
//!
//! [`channel`] will return two halves: [`TicketNotifier`] and
//! [`TicketReceiver`]. Ratelimiters must keep the notifier and give the user
//! the receiver in return.
//!
//! ## 3. Notifying the consumer of ticket approval
//!
//! When any ratelimits have passed and a user is free to perform their request,
//! call [`TicketNotifier::available`]. If the user hasn't canceled their
//! request for a ticket, you will receive a [`TicketHeaders`].
//!
//! ## 4. Receiving the response's headers
//!
//! The consumer will perform their HTTP request and parse the response's
//! headers. Once the headers (or lack of headers) are available the user will
//! send them along the channel. Poll the provided [`TicketHeaders`] for those
//! headers to complete the cycle.
//!
//! [`Ratelimiter::ticket`]: super::Ratelimiter::ticket
//! [`Ratelimiter`]: super::Ratelimiter
//! [must be parsed]: super::headers
