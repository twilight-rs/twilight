//! Payloads that are outgoing to the Discord Gateway API.
//!
//! These are sent by shards to the Discord API. Some payloads are required for
//! the operation of a shard; these are [`Heartbeat`], [`Identify`], and
//! [`Resume`]. Others - such as [`RequestGuildMembers`] - are for users to use
//! in their own operations.
//!
//! Refer to [Discord Docs / Gateway Commands][1] for Discord's documentation
//! about incoming and outgoing events.
