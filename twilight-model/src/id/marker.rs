//! Markers for various resource types, such as channels or users.
//!
//! Markers themselves perform no logical action, and are only used to
//! ensure that IDs of incorrect types aren't used. If IDs were only 64-bit
//! integers then a role's ID may be erroneously used in the place of where
//! a user's ID is required; by using markers it can be ensured that only an
//! ID with a [`RoleMarker`] can be used where a role's ID is required.

// DEVELOPMENT: When adding a new marker, be sure to add its implementation to
// `util/snowflake`.
