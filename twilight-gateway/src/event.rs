    /// circumstances. While specifying intents are required by Discord and
    /// allow filtering groups of [`Event`]s, event type flags are a
    /// Twilight-specific technique to filter out individual events from being
    /// deserialized at all, effectively discarding them.
    ///
    /// For example, [`Intents::GUILDS`] includes a wide range of events from
    /// [`GuildCreate`] to [`RoleUpdate`] to [`ChannelPinsUpdate`]. If the only
    /// events used in this group of events is, say, [`ChannelCreate`] and
    /// [`RoleCreate`], then the [`CHANNEL_CREATE`][Self::CHANNEL_CREATE] and
    /// [`ROLE_CREATE`][Self::ROLE_CREATE] event type flags can be specified in
    /// combination with that intent to only deserialize those events.
    ///
    /// Selected event types only affect the events returned by [`Shard`]s.
    /// Events necessary for maintaining the connection to Discord, such as
    /// [`GATEWAY_HEARTBEAT`][`Self::GATEWAY_HEARTBEAT`] and
    /// [`GATEWAY_HELLO`][`Self::GATEWAY_HELLO`], can safely be excluded and
