# twilight-http

[![discord badge][]][discord link] [![github badge][]][github link] [![license badge][]][license link] ![rust badge]

HTTP support for the twilight ecosystem.

## Features

### Deserialization

`twilight-http` supports [`serde_json`] and [`simd-json`] for deserializing
responses.

#### `simd-json`

The `simd-json` feature enables [`simd-json`] support to use simd features
of modern cpus to deserialize responses faster. It is not enabled by
default.

To use this feature you need to also add these lines to
`<project root>/.cargo/config`:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=native"]
```

You can also set the environment variable
`RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"`. If you enable both `serde_json` and
`simd-json` at the same time, then `simd-json` will be used.

To enable `simd-json`, do something like this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
twilight-http = { default-features = false, features = ["rustls", "simd-json"], version = "0.2" }
```

### TLS

`twilight-http` has features to enable [`hyper`]'s TLS features. These
features are mutually exclusive. `rustls` is enabled by default.

#### `native`

The `native` feature enables [`hyper`]'s `default-tls`
feature, which is mostly equivalent to using [`native-tls`].

To enable `native`, do something like this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
twilight-http = { default-features = false, features = ["native"], version = "0.2" }
```

#### `rustls`

The `rustls` feature enables [`hyper`]'s `rustls` feature, which uses
[`rustls`] as the TLS backend.

This is enabled by default.
